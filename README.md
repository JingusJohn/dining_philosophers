# Dining Philosophers Collection

These are by no means the greatest, most optimized, most stable, or most scalable implementations of the dining philosophers synchronization problem. They're just the ones that I came up with. The C implementation was the first one I wrote for a programming assignment in university. Every subsequent implementation is just a port of the C implementation. I've decided I'd like to do as many as I can.
